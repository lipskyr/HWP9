  Hello, <i>World</i>!
  I'm <b>glad</b> you're <u>here</u>!

<p>
This tag allows a paragraph to be set apart from other parts of the webpage.  It is surrounded by the p tag in order for that to happen well.  The text will stay together and not interfere with the rest of the page.  This is nice.

  There are a lot of reasons why this is a nice page:
  <ul>
    <li>I was able to make it very quickly.</li>
    <li>I am able to put lots of information on it.</li>
    <li>Many parts of it are <strike>speld</strike> spelled right.</li>
